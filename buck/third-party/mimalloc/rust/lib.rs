//! A module for using the **[mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc)**
//! memory allocator in Rust programs. mimalloc is a small, easy-to-understand,
//! scalable, cache-and-thread friendly memory allocator. It is written in C,
//! has no external dependencies, and is linked and exists entirely inside of
//! this crate.
//!
//! By design, this module is nearly opaque. The only supported APIs are using
//! [`MiMalloc`] with the [`#[global_allocator]` attribute][module@core::alloc],
//! and some tools for diagnostics. In the future this may expand to features
//! like dedicated heaps or arenas, if needed.
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! This is effectively a soft fork of the [mimalloc](https://docs.rs/mimalloc)
//! and [mimalloc-sys](https://docs.rs/mimalloc-sys) crates, merging them into
//! one module for our own needs with some extra cherries on top. There are also
//! an array of third party crates providing mimalloc support.
//!
//! The motivation for our own crates include, but are not limited to:
//!
//! - Usage of mimalloc 2.x, while many upstream crates use seem to still use
//!   the 1.x series,
//! - Reduce "crate bloat", as we have no need for separate `foo`/`foo-sys`
//!   designs,
//! - Have a space for _other_ C code in the future,
//! - Have better control over the exported API for deeper integration.
//!
//! Please read the top-level documentation for the [jj_cbits](../index.html)
//! crate for more information.
//!
//! In the future, it is possible these changes may be integrated back into a
//! more general, widely-usable crate.
//!
//! ## Basic usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[global_allocator]
//! static ALLOC: jj_cbits::mimalloc::MiMalloc = jj_cbits::mimalloc::MiMalloc;
//! ```

/// summary before printing to `stderr`, so while it will give a global summary
/// of the heap, it may cause some performance overhead while thread-local
/// buffers are being flushed and merged.

/// Typically, the callback function is provided as a simple closure with static
/// lifetime, as it may be called at any point in the program's lifetime. The
/// result of the closure is ignored and has no meaning.
///
/// The provided closure will be invoked at an unspecified future point with the
/// following arguments:
///
/// * `force`, type `bool`: If `true`, the deferred free function should free
///   any memory it has allocated, or that may be possible to free to reduce
///   heap pressure.
/// * `count`, type `c_ulonglong`: A monotonically increasing "heartbeat
///   counter." May be assigned any semantic meaning to your program that you
///   desire. This counter MUST NOT be assumed to have any relation to the
///   structure of the heap, in any way.
///
/// These two parameters are completely independent from each other; that is,
/// any combination of `force` and `count` may be provided to the callback and
/// should not be assumed to influence each other in any meaningful way.
///
/// Note that this function is called _deterministically_ based on heap
/// allocations. Therefore, assuming the program itself exhibits deterministic
/// allocation behavior the resulting deferred free callback will also be called
/// deterministically over the program's lifetime. The number of allocations
/// between invocations is unspecified.
///
/// Despite the name, this registered callback does not need to free any extra
/// memory in any way, and can be used purely as a "heartbeat" mechanism to
/// implement other functionality, such as periodic state logging or timeouts
/// that are not tied to the wall clock.
///
/// There may be only a single deferred free function registered at any given
/// time. If this function is called multiple times, the last registered
/// function will be used.
