# Buck2 Logs

These are tools for dealing with Buck2 logs, located under `buck-out/v2/log`.

Notably, there is a Deno server that can have log files uploaded into it and
serve them back later, as well as a tool for watching `buck-out/` directories
and uploading logs on demand.

## `upload` tool

TBD.

## `server` tool

TBD.
